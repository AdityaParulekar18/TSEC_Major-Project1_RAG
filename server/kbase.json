      "crop": "wheat",
      "disease": "Smut",
      "symptoms": "Infected wheat heads are replaced by black, powdery masses of spores; heads emerge earlier and appear darker; can reduce grain quality and yield.",
      "causes": "Caused by the fungus Ustilago tritici (Loose Smut) or similar smut fungi; seedborne infection where the fungus survives in the embryo of the seed.",
      "treatment": "Treat seeds with systemic fungicides; commercial seed treatment is recommended; hot water treatment can eliminate fungi but must be done carefully to avoid reducing seed vitality.",
      "prevention": "Use certified smut-free seed; plant resistant varieties; avoid planting infected seeds; long-term solution involves seed treatment and variety selection."

      "treatment": "Limited chemical treatments; antibiotics like streptomycin can be used but resistance is common; biocontrol agents such as antagonistic bacteria may help reduce severity.",
      "prevention": "Plant resistant varieties; use certified disease-free seeds; manage water levels to avoid flooding; avoid excessive nitrogen; crop rotation and sanitation of fields."

    {
      "crop": "rice",
      "disease": "Brown Spot",
      "symptoms": "Small, circular to oval brown spots on leaves, sheaths, and grains; spots may have yellow halos; severe infections cause leaf drying and reduced grain quality.",
      "causes": "Caused by the fungus Bipolaris oryzae; often associated with nutrient deficiencies (e.g., potassium); favored by stressed plants, high humidity, and moderate temperatures.",
      "treatment": "Apply fungicides such as mancozeb or propiconazole if detected early; improve plant nutrition to reduce susceptibility.",
      "prevention": "Plant resistant varieties; ensure balanced fertilization, especially potassium; avoid water stress; use certified seeds; crop rotation and residue removal."
