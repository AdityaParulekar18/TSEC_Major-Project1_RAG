Project Topic:- RAG-Enabled Early Disease & Pest Detection in Crops

ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project is a CNN + RAG powered web application that helps farmers and researchers detect crop diseases and pests early using images.
It combines:

1. CNN models (.h5) for image classification of Rice, Wheat, and Maize diseases.
2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to fetch detailed information and treatment suggestions.
3. Frontend UI designed using Bolt (no-code platform) with further customization.
4. Backend API integration for model prediction + RAG output, structured as server-client architecture with separate folders.

âœ¨ Features
1. Upload crop leaf images.
2. Predicts disease/pest class using trained CNN models.
3. Retrieves cause, symptoms, treatment, and prevention using RAG.
4. Generates farmer-friendly explanations with an LLM.
5. Clean, responsive UI for web and mobile access.
